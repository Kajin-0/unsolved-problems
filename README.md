# Unsolved Problems Board (auto‑user detection)

A zero‑backend board for unsolved problems on **GitHub Pages**.
No hard‑coded username—works immediately after forking.

## Deploy

1. Upload / push to a repo named **unsolved-problems** under your account.
2. Enable **Settings → Pages → Source → /docs folder**.
3. Visit `https://<your-user>.github.io/unsolved-problems/`.

The “+ Add a problem” button and issue fetcher automatically use your account name
extracted from the page’s hostname, so no manual edits are required.
