# Unsolved Problems Board (seeded demo)

A zero-backend board for posting and browsing unsolved problems, built on
**GitHub Pages** and **GitHub Issues**.

This starter version pre-loads three famous Clay Millennium problems
via `docs/seeds.json` so you have content on first deploy.

## Quick start

1. Replace `<user>` in **docs/index.html** and **docs/main.js** with your GitHub username.
2. Push / upload the repo and enable **Settings → Pages → Source → `/docs` folder**.
3. Visit `https://<user>.github.io/unsolved-problems/`.

Add or remove starter problems by editing `docs/seeds.json`.  User‑submitted
problems go through the “+ Add a problem” Issue Form and appear instantly.
